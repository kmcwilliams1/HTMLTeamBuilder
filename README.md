# HTMLTeamBuilder
Licenses used - whatever licesnses are a part of jest, and inquirer. pretty sure it's MIT. And whatever bootstrap uses. Also MIT I think?

Thoughts on the project - This was a tough one. I'm not sure how I feel about TDD, there is a lot of foreward thinking that has to occur to make sure you have all the tests ready to go before even starting to code. Maybe Im too reckless but part of the fun of coding is angrily wondering why your code wont work and having to comb through it, trying to find the errors. But on the brightside, this was the most amount of coding I did without any help, and the help I recieved was all stuff I could understand, even if I didnt think of doing it to begin with. 

To test this bad boy - just node index.js and type in the fields requested. I wanted to do a better layout, and may continue to get it looking better, but for now, it all works without setting anything on fire which is good enough for me.
